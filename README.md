# odin-recipes
A beginner website made to demonstrate basic html. 
This little website will feature three links recipes, images of those recipes, and will all be completed using my new found html knowledge. 
Enjoy the recipes!

Post: HTML Project: 
    I really enjoyed making this. My entire life this sort of thing has felt unaccessible, let Odin Project helped me guide myself through the steps. 

CSS: 
    I am beginning to incorporte css into my recipes page on 1/27/22.
